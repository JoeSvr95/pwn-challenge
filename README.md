In the `py-measure` directory you will find the solution to the python challenge. It contains a package named timer which includes a Timer class that you can use to measure the executiong time of a function.

Usage:

```python
t = Timer()

t.start()

# Your code here

t.stop()
```

# Frontend Challenge

In the `auto-save` directory you will find the solution written in Vue.js. It uses the Vue.js CDN, so you only have to run the index.html in the browser.
